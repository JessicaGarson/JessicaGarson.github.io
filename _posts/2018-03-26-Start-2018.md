My new years resolution was to give one speaking role at a meet up or a conference.

In January, I gave portfolio reviews at [Women who Code NYC](https://www.meetup.com/WomenWhoCodeNYC/events/245474584/). This was my first time giving feedback like this and I got see so many awesome personal websites.

In February, I gave a DJ set as Messica Arson with [Live Code NYC](http://livecode.nyc/) where I wrote code in Ruby with Sonic Pi and sampled myself screaming into a USB microphone.

This past month, I helped plan the [Crack the Code conference](https://www.crackthecode.io/) for progressive women in data. I was inspired by other performers at Live Code NYC and wanted to play around with tidalcycles a library for haskell. I gave a [5 minute DJ set at Hack&&Tell DC](https://twitter.com/DCHackAndTell/status/973714675786502144). I also wrote about [giving lighting talks for dev.to](https://dev.to/jessicagarson/how-giving-lightning-talks-helped-me-gain-technical-confidence--2omm).

I'm very excited for the next few months. I'm planning on releasing another zine - let me know if you want to contribute, building out Nominate Her and learning some new things.
