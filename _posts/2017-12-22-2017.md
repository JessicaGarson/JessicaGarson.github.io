This year has been quite exciting. I'm currently living in New York and teaching at [NYU's introduction to programming with Python](https://www.sps.nyu.edu/professional-pathways/diplomas/technology/introduction-to-programming-with-python.html). 

Highlights include organizing another successful [Tech Lady Hackathon](https://developer.washingtonpost.com/pb/blog/post/2017/10/23/recap-top-women-in-tech-hosted-by-the-washington-post-at-fifth-annual-tech-lady-hackathon/) with over 350 attendees, helping to design the curriculum for [Change the Game Training](http://www.changethegame.io/) and gaviving a talk at [HackNY on APIs](http://hackny.org/2017/10/f2017-recap/).

I started a project called [NominateHer](http://www.nominateher.org), which is a list of awards women can get nominated for. This won [Best Web/Mobile Product of the Year by Technical.ly](https://technical.ly/dc/2017/12/07/heres-winners-2017-technical-ly-dc-awards/).

I'm very excited to work on new projects in the new year.
