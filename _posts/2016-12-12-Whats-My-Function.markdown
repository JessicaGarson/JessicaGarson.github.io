I released a new issue of What's My Function. What's My Function is a programming zine for beginners. This is the third edition and it walks you through how to create a personal site very similar to this one. You can get a copy [on my github](https://github.com/JessicaGarson/Whats-my-function-3/blob/master/WMF3.pdf).
